        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-3 pb-2">Introduction</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          The basis of personalized and adaptive learning is nurturing a learning strategy or experience by utilizing learning resources and adapting them to benefit students based on their previous knowledge and learning preferences. Pedagogies with
          personalized and adaptive learning provide students with learning materials and assessments curated to their needs and preferences for optimized learning. Students whose learning preferences are catered to find their learning experiences
          more enjoyable and engage more deeply with their resources while learning at their own pace and level of interest.
        </p>

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-3 pb-2">Research Work</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Our research aims to identify the requirements of a Learning Management System (LMS) in an online e-learning setting for programming languages education and identify a suitable algorithm, including machine learning, to enable personalized
          and adaptive learning. Actualize was designed for programming languages education. Actualize can record, analyze, and track students' behavior and actions to maintain an accurate student model and intelligently deliver learning resources
          and adaptive assessments.

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-3 pb-2">Why programming languages education?</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Personalized and adaptive learning is suited for learning just about anything under any field, we chose to specialize in programming languages because an effective implementation could help struggling students as well as attract non-STEM
          students. It's also familiar with our class audience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Challenges in programming education:
          <ul>
            <li>Students prefer different modalities (e.g., videos, slides, readings, demonstrations, documentation, etc.).</li>
            <li>Some resources are more effective than others.</li>
            <li>Structured learning is non-personalized.</li>
            <li>Structured learning is non-dynamic.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-3 pb-2">What can personalized and adaptive learning bring to programming language education?</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Personalized and adaptive learning can offer students effective and efficient learning tailored to their preferences.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Benefits in programming education applications:
          <ul>
            <li>Students are accommodated with learning resources that they find engaging.</li>
            <li>The quality of learning resources is optimal.</li>
            <li>Learning is personalized.</li>
            <li>Learning is adaptive.</li>
          </ul>
