        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-3 pb-2">Introduction</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          The basis of personalized and adaptive learning is delivering a personalized learning experience by utilizing learning resources and adapting them to benefit students based on their previous knowledge and learning preferences. Pedagogies with personalized and adaptive learning provide students with learning materials and assessments curated to their needs and preferences for optimized learning. Students whose learning preferences are catered to find their learning experiences more enjoyable and engage more deeply with their resources while learning at their own pace and level of interest.
        </p>

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-3 pb-2">Research Work</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Our research aims to identify a Learning Management System (LMS) requirements in an online e-learning setting for programming languages education and identify a suitable algorithm, including machine learning, to enable personalized and adaptive learning. Actualize was designed for programming languages education. Actualize can record, analyze, and track students' behavior and actions to maintain an accurate student model and intelligently deliver learning resources and adaptive assessments.

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-3 pb-2">Why programming languages education?</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Personalized and adaptive learning is suited for learning just about anything in any field. We chose to specialize in programming languages because an effective implementation could help struggling students and attract non-STEM students. It's also familiar with our class audience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Challenges in programming education:
          <ul>
            <li>Students prefer different modalities (e.g., videos, slides, readings, demonstrations, documentation, etc.).</li>
            <li>Some resources are more effective than others.</li>
            <li>Structured learning is non-personalized.</li>
            <li>Structured learning is non-dynamic.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-3 pb-2">What can personalized and adaptive learning bring to programming language education?</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Personalized and adaptive learning can offer students effective and efficient learning tailored to their preferences.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">
          Benefits in programming education applications:
          <ul>
            <li>Students are accommodated with learning resources that they find engaging.</li>
            <li>The quality of learning resources is optimal.</li>
            <li>Learning is personalized.</li>
            <li>Learning is adaptive.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-2 pb-2">Project Overview</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">Our prototype concept was built as a Python programming language education course. This section gives a general overview of how the course could work with our system.</p>

        <h5 class="d-block text-muted pt-2 pb-2">Scenario</h5>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">A student has joined a popular online course to learn to program with Python. The course itself makes use of the Actualize LMS that implements personalized and adaptive learning. In this course, there is only one instructor, and there are many students. The Actualize system automatically delivers the appropriate learning materials to each student based on their knowledge and learning preferences. Actualize can deliver assessments to measure student learning and adapt to the progress.</p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center my-5 mx-1">
          <div class="card border-secondary p-0" style="max-width: 500px">
            <div class="card-header">Storyboard</div>
            <img src="./images/s1.jpg" class="card-img-top p-3" alt="Student paths" />
            <div class="card-footer pt-3">
              <h5 class="card-title">Setting learning preferences example</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                As shown above, the student may detail their learning preferences within Actualize. This data is used in the Python course to deliver content that is compatible with students’ learning preferences and adapts to their knowledge growth.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h5 class="d-block text-muted pt-2 pb-2">Implementing Personalized and Adaptive Learning</h5>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">The role of the teacher is both educator and administrator. They have the ability to see a detailed overview of the entire course, where they can monitor the students’ progress and identify struggling students. Teachers can also add material to the course, like learning and assessment content.</p>

        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">The course resources contain metadata that allows the algorithm to identify the modalities that each resource can accommodate and the modality information of the resource. Additional information would also include the difficulty, estimated study time for study resources, and the estimated completion time for assessment questions. The LMS would organize course resources within a tree data structure. Individual lessons, examples, exercises, grouped materials, or assessment questions would be the leaves, and each higher level would be the category or course module that they belong to.</p>

        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">The Actualize algorithm would traverse the tree to identify the learning resources that best suit each student. As more data is through the course and future courses, the LMS can use machine learning to identify the most effective resources for certain learning preferences and weed out ineffective resources for elimination or improvement. The course educator would supervise the machine learning implementation to approve or modify the data according to their interpretation of the course outcomes and the course structure and logistics.</p>

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-2 pb-2">Actualize Demo</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">A demo of our project is available <a href="http://cs3.calstatela.edu/~cs4540stu20/index.html" target="_blank">here<i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i></a>.</p>
        
        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-2 pb-2">Progress Report</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">More than anything, we learned a lot thanks to the research that we completed. This knowledge allowed us to design the requirements for the Actualize LMS. Our research taught us the concepts and details to make that essential process possible; we learned about learning style detection and adaptation. We learned about learning path delivery and personalization. We also explored the concepts and applications of intelligent agents and machine learning. Actualize likely has the potential to move on to the next step, where we could develop a proof of concept with some additional work.</p>

        <h4 class="d-block text-muted pt-2 pb-2">Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="text-body pb-3 mb-0 lh-sm">Actualize is our vision for a personalized and adaptive learning LMS deployment in an online Python education environment. In essence, the most important aspect of our vision for personalized and adaptive learning is how the student model is continuously refined within the Actualize LMS to deliver learning and assessment resources intelligently. The realization of our work could make learning programming languages easier and more accessible for students and more efficient and engaging. We hope to see growth in programming education, both in and outside of STEM education.
